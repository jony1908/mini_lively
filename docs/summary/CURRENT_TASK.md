## Technical Considerations

### Authentication Integration
- Profile endpoints require JWT authentication
- Profile context should integrate with existing AuthContext
- Handle authentication errors gracefully

### Data Validation
- Frontend validation should match backend Pydantic schemas
- Postal code format validation by country
- Activity preference data structure consistency

### User Experience
- Progressive profile completion (not all fields required)
- Clear indication of optional vs required fields
- Smooth onboarding flow for new users

### Performance
- Lazy loading for profile components
- Efficient state management
- Optimized API calls (avoid unnecessary requests)
